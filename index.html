          <br>
          <p>Classroom teacher turned software developer.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Always interested in the next challenge, my professional trajectory continues to revolve around
identifying problems and finding solutions.</p>
<br>
<p>As a Teach for America corps member, along the Texas - Mexico border and later as a classroom teacher
in Denver, I found that students were most passionate, engaged and enthusiastic about literature when
reading stories of adolescents facing the same challenges as themselves. Thus, I built a curriculum
enveloped in stories of identity, internal struggle, and personal growth and was able to transform
studentsâ€™ relationships to books.</p>
<br>
<p>On my summers off, I worked with public defenders to understand their needs and develop a game plan
for the best investigation possible. This often meant piecing together disjointed crime scenes and
interviews to find the commonalities and provide the best evidence for attorneys possible.</p>
<br>
<p>Like the classroom and the courtroom, the tech market does best when understanding its clients. I see
usability, design, and functionality as key levers to building a relationship between a client and a
technology.</p>
